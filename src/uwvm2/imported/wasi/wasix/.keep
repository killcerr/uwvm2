Regarding Wasix, I personally believe it is overdesigned and will not be considered for implementation at this time. The community will fill in the gaps later. In my opinion, for example, Wasix's proc_fork makes it extremely difficult to pass the same context to different processes (this becomes even more challenging under layered compilation (interpreter and JIT), debugging environments, and performance counter modes).
