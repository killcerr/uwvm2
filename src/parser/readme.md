# WebAssembly parser
Provide a conceptualization of an extensible parser

* `base` Some basic structures
* `binfmt` Parsing implementations and storage constructs for different wasm binary format versions, automatic synthesis via the concept of binfmt
* `concept` Some template metaprogramming, or the lowest level wasm composition concepts, including binfmt categorization, etc.
* `feature` Provide supported feature macros
* `proposal` Support for the wasm proposal. Includes structures corresponding to proposals, parsing programs, command code definition
* `standard` Support for the wasm standard. Includes standardized structural equivalents, parsing programs, command code definition
